A well-designed dataset is the foundation of any supervised machine learning task. This study compiled three purpose-built datasets to reflect real-world acoustic conditions. 
These datasets were carefully curated to capture a variety of vehicle fault sounds, emergency sirens, and environmental noise, ensuring diversity and domain relevance.
This section details the content and structure of each dataset. It outlines their significance in evaluating the system’s robustness across different sound categories.
In this study, we extended and refined the structure of two previously developed datasets — Vehicular Acoustic Fault Dataset (VAFD) and Urban Emergency and Ambient Sound Dataset (UEASD) — originally introduced in our prior work [11], to enhance their coverage, balance, and suitability for machine learning-based sound classification tasks. as shown in Table 2.
Enhancements to VAFD: The Vehicular Acoustic Fault Dataset (VAFD), which captures a broad spectrum of mechanical fault sounds across vehicle subsystems (e.g., engine, powertrain, suspension, steering), was enriched to improve class diversity and realism. Specifically, we introduced a new category, "General Vehicle Sounds", to represent normal operational noises, thereby facilitating the discrimination between faulty and non-faulty acoustic patterns. Additionally, we added a new fault label, "Timing Chain Noise", increasing the total number of labeled classes in VAFD from 27 to 29.
Enhancements to UEASD: The Urban Emergency and Ambient Sound Dataset (UEASD), designed to encompass non-vehicular sounds such as emergency alerts, animal calls, and construction noises, was expanded to improve its representation of diverse acoustic environments. We introduced a new category, "Weather Sounds", which includes natural phenomena like rain and thunder. Moreover, we added two critical safety-related categories: "Fire Alarms" and "Forest Fire Sounds", as well as a new environmental sound class, "Snake Sounds", to further broaden the dataset’s utility for public safety and environmental monitoring applications. Detailed label information is provided in the Appendix.
These enhancements improve the realism and balance of each dataset and support more nuanced classification tasks involving both vehicle-specific and environmental acoustic events. These refined datasets were later combined to form the Integrated Vehicle and Environmental Sound Dataset (IVESD), enabling more complex multi-domain classification challenges, as detailed in the following section.

Dataset	Description
Vehicular Acoustic Fault Dataset (VAFD)	Curated to represent vehicle-related fault sounds across subsystems and include general operational audio. Designed to support diagnostic model development through acoustic analysis.
Urban Emergency and Ambient Sound Dataset (UEASD)	Includes emergency signals (e.g., sirens), environmental noises, animal sounds, and construction sounds. Structured to support acoustic scene analysis, anomaly detection, and public safety research.
Integrated Vehicle and Environmental Sound Dataset (IVESD)	Merges VAFD and UEASD into a comprehensive multi-domain collection, facilitating the creation of robust models capable of distinguishing between mechanical faults and environmental sounds.
